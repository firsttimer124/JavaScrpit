<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><b>Javascript is a programming language used in Web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. Javascript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processes ny the client's web browser rather than on the web browser. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. For example, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server.</p></b>

<h1>Things we can do from Javascript</h1>

<li><b>Adding interactive behavior to web pages.</li>
<li>Creating web and mobile apps.</li>
<li>Developers can use various Javascript frameworks for developing and buliding web and mobile apps.</li>
<li>Buliding web servers and developing server applications.</li>
</b>
</ul>

<h1>Javascript for web development</h1>
<p><b>Javascript most popular use for web development, and it is one of the most powerful tools a developer can have on their toolbelt. Developers use Javascript in web development to add interactivity and features to improve the user experience and make the internet much more enjoyable. Javascript has exapnded well beyond front-end development, which is where it started. More recently, Javascript has expanded to the back end of web development and can be used across the full stack. This means that developers have front-end access to CRUD (Create,Read,Update,Destory) methods and can now even be used on the back end of a website.</p></b>

<h1>How does Javascript work?</h1>
<p><b>JavaScript is considered a client-side scripiting language, which means that it operates on the user's browser and does not function on an external device. An example of a language that is not client-side would be MySQL, a server-side langugae that handles any database requests. Javascript also does not require that anything be dowloaded to the user's devices, as modern browsers have the required software intergated into them. This makes JavaScript much more user-friendly than some other languages can be.</p></b>
